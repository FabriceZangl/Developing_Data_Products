Introduction
========================================================

Make sure to go in full screen in the browser by clicking *F11* and to remove/hide the toolbars in RPubs (see option at the bottom right)

For the font friends, please note that I've set the font to *Verdana*, which assumes that this font is available on your system. Otherwise a default font will be displayed.

If you're curious to see how I **embedded the shinyapp into the presentation** or the **HTML code into the 'Help' tab**, you can find the source code for the visual and for the deck under

Why O'k-meaner?
========================================================

**O'k-meaner** is in app that let's you explore datasets with *k-means*.

<h4>Pick any feature and number of clusters!</h4>
<h3>Check out the result in a plot to see your insights!</h3>
<h4>Future realeases will include the possibility to pick a dataset.</h4>

<h6>It's a working prototype currently limited to mtcars dataset</h6>
