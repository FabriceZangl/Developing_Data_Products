```{r plotly, echo = TRUE}
if(!require(plotly)) {install.packages("plotly"); require(plotly)}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))

# to host plots, visit htts://plot.ly/
data(mtcars)
plot_ly(mtcars, x = mtcars$wt, y = mtcars$mpg, mode = "markers")
data(trees)
plot_ly(trees, x = trees$Girth, y = trees$Volume, mode = "markers", color = trees$Height)
# you can also add a variable as the optional input for the size of the marker.
# if your colour variable is categorical, plotly will recognize it automatically.
# Plotly also enables 3D scatterplots. You just need to specify z dimension and specify "type = scatter3d"
